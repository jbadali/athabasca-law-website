I wanted to write a poem. It's been five years since my last excursion living abroad and I think I came at 
at this opportunity with less of the wide-eyed enthusiasm as in my early twenties, and more with the cynicism
of law student instilled with a rote way of learning and thinking. International law has condemned the Serbian government 
for war crimes following the disolution of Yugoslavia and the trial (name) of the former Yugo continues today.
Issues at the intersection of race, gender, sexuality, and ... still pervade legal discourse not only here but in
Canada.
"You must hate us" joke some of the friends I've met when they find out I'm from Canada.
But admidst all of the vilification the Serbian government from international bodies, the subtlety of
personal relations and ... subterfuges(thes.) the narrative of Serbia's socio-political and cultural
situation. The discourse around these issues are, and *Feel* much more complex when you meet the people
they affect, and not the government officials who enact draconian laws/cause protest.

What would writing a poem about this experience have offered me/contributed to my understanding of it? I think it would capture the emotions and lack of logic behind seeing
the reality for what it is and feeling more empathy. The pounding bassline in Euro-headbanger Abba remixes, Super Trooper, 
encountering the hostility of men (a man apologized to me- a bystander- after he spat on a woman pushing a stroller) and
men who resist the patriarchy.
what is that insect with tongue?

I also experienced the familiar theoretical and historical practical issues in psychiatry that were almost 
considered psychological folklore in my master's program. Psychiatric asylums, existant for centuries in midieval
times to institutionalize ... came to an end in Canada in the 1970's. Depicted in movies such as
Girl Interrupted, the effects of institutionalization not only worsened many womens' conditions, but
effectively prevented any reintegration into mainstream society. The psychiatric consumer movement in 
the 1970's and 80's ushered in a client-centred era of psychiatric care wherein people afflicted by mental disabilities
took care of themselves through community supports (which still may include short-term institutionalization)
but to a much lesser degree than institutionalization in asylums far removed from urban areas and which
involved the ...compromising... of the person's legal capacity. The psychiatric consumer revolution
has been ...coined... in the term "nothing about us without us" (Source), a play on the infamous trials 
of Nazi leaders which were said to be "about us without us" (source).

I was astonished to learn then, that Serbia was still in the midst of institutionalization, replete with
apparently common issues of legal capacity deprivation and maltreatment made notorious in flims like Girl Interrupted or One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest.
Tucked away in rural areas of Serbia, issues related to the rights and well-being of people with disabilities
might still not in the forefront of the government's agenda without the impetus of the accession to the European Union. The EU
 

But it's difficult to reconcile the notion that human rights issues are predicated on political reforms,
and not the compassion that one would assume catalyzes most human rights movements. However, from my
experience working with counselling services and speaking to mental health service providers, psychologists,
and psychiatrist, even in Canada the issue of institutionalization is still divisive. Moreover, I've
learned to understand that where someone stands on these issues related to human rights is more nuanced than right
or wrong. Morality is influenced by culture, history, economy, and lived experience, and so peoples' 
understanding of the dilemma of institutionalization is understandably not uniform. Human rights are not 
static (or unified), although we like to think they are, necessitating that human rights movements
engender discussion from all levels of governance, but especially the groups affected. It seems obvious that decisions about
people with disabilities' rights should not be made without them. But at the same time, someone's 
morality ought not be judged on the basis of their ...upbringing... Compassion is dynamic and often
involves struggling with our own beliefs to understand others. This struggle was poignantly real in
a two-day training with staff from psychiatric institutions who themselves struggled to relay
the efforts they take to provide adequate care and their desire for social change/reform, yet the
issues of funding and systemic issues such as deeply-embedded societal sexism. The notion that people 
working in these institutions display such compassion attitudes drives me to understand
what morals underlie the government's continued (yet costly) belief in institutionalization. Ultimately,
finding out what values guide these high-up decisions is the work of civil society organizations on the
front lines of advocacy and cross-sectoral dialogue.

Compassion shows itself in not only between humans, but in our interactions with our environment, a life lesson
I stress is key to building a prosperous and caring society.

Over the three months, I (noticed/)felt (a/)the(/my) familiar conflicting feelings about my life-long 
love for animals. Known among my peers for my free-ganism, or being a vegetarian unless the opportunity to eat 
meat "free"ly presents itself, I generally espouse the values of vegetarianism not because of animal rights specifically but because
of the impact that moderate meat consumption represents in terms of reducing excessive consumerism, unnecessary
local environmental degradation, and increasing detachment of Westerners from mass food production and its effects 
on climate change. Weary of the sense of Western delusionment and entitlement that this purported vegetarianism by
convenience carries with it, I am open to "meat-eating" experiences when immersed in new cultures. 
Meanwhile, my conflicting relationship with animals manifested itself a second, and perhaps more unsettling, way. I found myself again faced with the familiar task of 
balancing the Western stereotype of pandering to stray dogs' needs while virtually appearing ignorant to the plight of
people who are homeless in Belgrade. Having lived in rural Korea where eating certain 
types of dogs was acceptable (although considered illegal), being seen petting dogs on the street looks as assinine
as stopping to pet pigs on a Canadian highway (which never happens, right -- insert link). Despite this, my fear
of revealing myself to be the naive Western tourist in Belgrade was not so certain of a fate as in Korea (issues of race not withstanding- I look Serbian). 
I noticed many people in Belgrade perhaps felt the same cognitive dissonance that I did-- the internal conflict
of owning a dog and treating it well in spite of other's socio-economic circumstances. 
 Ownership of dogs/Canine companions were quite common, but strays were equally visible 
around town or in the city's many parks.
Nonetheless, it was not uncommon for locals to be friendly with stray dogs and cats, and meanwhile understanding of
Serbia's human rights issues, political situation, and inequality among certain demographics. 
[All this to say that I truly felt less ridiculous for my lifelong belief that the way we treat dogs is important for the very reason 
that the way we treat each other is reflected in the way we treat animals.]
I experienced the reality that some Serbians are equally conflicted about their love/compassion for dogs first hand. 
Midway through my internship, my best friend, and dog who I had for twelve years and was deemed perfectly healthy at his yearly check-up only a week before 
I left to Belgrade, suddenly became seriously ill and had to be put down. I didn't speak about the event
at work but posted a link of facebook about all the lessons I learned from having my silly dog as a best
friend. A few days later, at the end of the work day, one of my supervisors approached me once everyone had left and
...sympathetically... said "hey, i saw about your dog on facebook. and i want you to know i understand how hard it is.
people think maybe it's crazy, and selfish, but when i lost my dog, i went through the same thing."
+ link-- I was heart-broken, but stunned by the outpouring I received from friends back home, friends who
have owned dogs, friends from many different provinces (and territories), friends from different socio-economic backgrounds
all telling me that i was sane. okay, maybe not. but my love for a dog was not as selfish as i had feared, even
six thousand kilometers away from home (check distance). 
and how i said at first meeting it was my biggest fear. 

[All this to say that I truly felt less ridiculous for my lifelong belief that the way we treat dogs is important for the very reason 
that the way we treat each other is reflected in the way we treat animals.]


It's been said in other ways, like a society is only as strong as its weakest member. BUT 
my normative assumptions come from lived experience-
( what i've seen is/a common trend is that there is a correlation between // My understanding is that
(the effects of) our relationship to animals is manifested in the way we treat our communities, our/a (healthy) respect(appreciation) 
for life, and sense of humility knowing that we are not above anyone.)
My understanding is that a positive relationship to animals fosters compassionate communities, a respect
for life, and sense of humility knowing that we are not above anyone else.

Writing this, I have no idea what the relationship between my love for my dog has to do with human rights, much less law.
But I think by removing myself from the legal context and returning to my values that brought me to law school is a
reminder of the purpose and foundation of law. Law is often [debatedbly] built/predicated on normative values, and judges often make law based on 
values (quote by australian gay judge)... Human rights legal frameworks thus emerge from common understandings,
empathy, and compassion. Sharing stories of hardship, whether it's the "pet"ty loss of an animal friend, or
the abuses facing instituationalized women with disabilities forms the foundation a society that cares about
change, whether merely normative or purportedly purely legal.  

The way we treat each other is reflected in th ew

I may be less jaded now, but I still didn't write a poem.
